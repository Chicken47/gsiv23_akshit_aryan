In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### Key Achievements Demonstrating Proficiency

- Dynamic Routing using react-router-dom: instead of calling another API for searching the specific title on details page, use global state of movie list to filter out thte result.
- Global State Management: I jhave worked with redux, contextAPI and Recoil. Recoil has been the easiest to use and the most react-y with the lease boilerplate code and there are hooks as well for ease-of-use.
- Fully Responsive Implementation: used tailwind css which made it easier to write responsive components. (can be converted to normal css as well using extensions/tools if required, i can also write normal css, if using tailwindcss is an issue).
- API Integration: i usually use axios for my API calls.

### List what you would do to improve your solution if you had 4 more hours available for this task

- Error Handling: better ux
- Unit Testing: I dont really have experience in test driven development. I have written tests in cypress in the past but that was to train a new joinee.
- Loaders (might end up adding, can get annoying without)

### Any feedback about how we may improve this challenge

- freedom to change design to make it a better ux. (personal opinion). otherwise this challenge is comprehensive and gets most of the concepts of coding in react. (i was a little confused with the usage of the words 'recommend', I did start it with TDD but the progress was painstakingly slow. When i restarted without it took me about 4 hours to make.)
